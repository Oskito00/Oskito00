### About Me

I'm a Tech Lead at **Logan Sinclair**, a boutique recruitment firm in financial services. I design and build ML-powered platforms for intelligent candidate sourcing and matching — semantic search, NLP pipelines, and full-stack tooling that makes recruiters faster and smarter.

Outside of work, I build things that interest me: voice-controlled AI assistants, sports prediction models, and automation tools.
